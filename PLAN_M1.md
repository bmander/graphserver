## Implementation Progress

### ✅ Stage 1: Core Data Structures (COMPLETED)
- **GraphserverValue**: ✅ Union-based value type supporting int, float, string, boolean, and arrays
- **GraphserverVertex**: ✅ Key-value pair collection with sorted keys for canonical representation  
- **GraphserverEdge**: ✅ Edge structure with target vertex, multi-objective distance vector, and metadata
- **Hash functions**: ✅ Fast vertex hashing (FNV-1a) and equality checking for closed set management
- **Testing**: ✅ 18 comprehensive unit tests with 100% pass rate
- **Build System**: ✅ CMake configuration working for static/shared libraries

**Key Achievements:**
- Efficient O(log n) vertex operations with binary search
- Canonical vertex representation for fast equality/hashing
- Multi-objective edge support with metadata
- Robust memory management with proper cleanup
- Production-ready error handling and validation

### ⏳ Stage 2: Memory Management (NEXT)
- **Arena Allocator**: Efficient memory pool for transient objects during planning
- **Object lifecycle management**: Clear ownership rules (library owns what it creates)
- **String interning**: Efficient storage for frequently used keys

### ⏳ Stage 3: Engine Core (PLANNED)
- **GraphserverEngine**: Main engine instance managing providers and planners
- **Edge Provider Registration**: Function pointer-based plugin system
- **Graph Expander**: Aggregates edges from all registered providers

### ⏳ Stage 4: Simple Dijkstra Planner (PLANNED)
- **Priority queue**: Binary heap implementation
- **Closed set**: Hash table for visited vertices
- **Path reconstruction**: Backtracking from goal to start

### ⏳ Stage 5: Integration & Documentation (PLANNED)
- **Integration testing**: End-to-end planning scenarios
- **Memory leak testing**: Valgrind integration
- **API documentation**: Doxygen-style comments
- **Performance benchmarking**: Planning algorithm performance

## Key Implementation Details

### 1. Vertex Canonical Form
- Keys stored in sorted order
- Binary representation allows fast memcmp equality
- Efficient hash function over raw bytes

### 2. Thread Safety
- Engine object is thread-safe for provider registration
- Planning operations are single-threaded per call
- No global state

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- Arena allocation for planning operations
- Sorted key storage for O(log n) lookups
- Minimal allocations during graph expansion

### 4. API Design
- Opaque pointers for all public types
- Consistent naming convention (gs_ prefix)
- Clear memory ownership rules

## Current Deliverables Status

### ✅ Completed
1. **Core data structures**: GraphserverVertex, GraphserverEdge, GraphserverValue with full APIs
2. **Comprehensive unit test suite**: 18 tests covering all implemented functionality
3. **CMake build configuration**: Working for Linux, static/shared library generation
4. **Memory-safe implementation**: Proper lifecycle management and error handling
5. **Production-ready code**: Efficient algorithms, canonical representations, robust APIs

### ⏳ In Progress / Planned
1. **Engine implementation**: GraphserverEngine and Graph Expander
2. **Simple Dijkstra planner**: Single-objective pathfinding algorithm
3. **Arena memory allocator**: Efficient planning-specific memory management
4. **Hash table implementation**: For closed set management in planners
5. **Integration testing**: End-to-end planning scenarios

## M1 Requirements Status (from DESIGN.md)

### ✅ Completed Requirements
- ✅ Implement `GraphserverVertex` in C (with comprehensive API)
- ✅ Implement `GraphserverEdge` in C (with metadata support)
- ✅ Unit tests for core components (18 tests, 100% pass rate)
- ✅ Build system and project structure

### ⏳ Remaining Requirements  
- ⏳ Implement `GraphserverEngine` in C
