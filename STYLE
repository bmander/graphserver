# Graphserver Styleguide.

## A note

These principles are broken by older code. Over time, the entire codebase should conform.

## Principles 

Classes are camel-cased. Instance variable are lower-cased, with underscores between words.

Longform variables "longform_variable" are good, but don't go overboard. Shortform variables "x1" are okay when conforming to well established convention.

Items in a vector of items of homogenous type are named (object1, object2, object3) et cetera.

Name like object_property not object_propertytype. For example, "arrival_time" not "arrival_secs".

## Preferred Terms

arrival_time
departure_time
